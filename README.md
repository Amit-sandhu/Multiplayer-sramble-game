# Multiplayer sramble game
This is the code of a multiplayer game to be played on the terminal (no UI). the aim of the game is to guess a random scrambled word in minimum tries and whichever player takes the least guesses to get the word right wins ! i tried to haddle most errors but still i might have some errors based on inputs or something else..
